Cards Planning


In this project, we'll try to simulate a card pack. We make no efforts to recognize the color of cards (r/b)

class Cards()
    Methods:
        - shuffle
        - draw 
        - burn
        - peek
        - return_card

Facts:
52 cards
4 different suites
13 value cards in each suite

Methodology:

I think the hardest part of this project is going to be creating the deck. 
When the class is called, it will initialize the deck and store all 52 cards. 
deck = {'Ace':[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,]}
